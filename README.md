# odin-recipes
TOP recipe project

[Function]
A recipe website with relative links to a spaghetti, burger, and pancakes html files. 

[Reflection]
Recipes, for the most part are easy to copy and paste once the format for each recipe website is decided. Take consideration with file type and size.
Resized images far too late in development. Take image dimensions into consideration when designing a webpage/website. Commit messages small with minor changes
